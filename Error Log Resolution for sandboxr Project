Problem: Cannot build images from Docker Hub on GitLabs
Errors on Building image from docker Hub

$CI_BUILD_TOKEN is an enviroment variable, which is defined right here:
https://blog.anynines.com/mastering-continuous-integration-and-continuous-deployment-with-gitlab/

Thought:

Should I be using job specific variables like Jeff or like above in my YAML?
Enviroment variables are defined at Gitlab->Project->Settings-CI/CD
 I thought the $CI_BUILD_TOKEN is defined at runtime?
http://mikevanriel.com/2016/08/31/automatically-building-a-docker-container-using-gitlab-ci/
"The text $CI_BUILD_TOKEN should not be replaced; this represents an internal environment variable containing the 
token used to sign into your own private registry."

I think travis needs a Rscript at the end with something to verify it worked

Building Docker image notes

    - docker build -t hub.docker.com/petergensler/sandboxr .
    - docker push hub.docker.com/petergensler/sandboxr:latest

gives me:
error parsing HTTP 404 response body: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value: "<html>\r\n<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>\r\n<body bgcolor=\"white\">\r\n<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

Building with Gitlab  with no push to gitlab
  script:
    - docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p $CI_BUILD_TOKEN registry.gitlab.com
    - docker build -t registry.gitlab.com/petergensler/sandboxr .
#    - docker push hub.docker.com/petergensler/sandboxr:latest
  only:
    - master

yields:
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
Login Succeeded

Resolution:
It seems like Gitlabs wants to:
a. build your container with your dockerfile hosted on Gitlabs
b. use the - docker:dind to build (Docker in Docker) and push to Gitlabs for CI and hosting

Problem: Cannot login into Gitlab with the following command:
docker login registry.gitlab.com -u petergensler -p Qadi53y1HeCCpezmWRsq

Currently, it was like this:
{
"auths" : {
"https://index.docker.io/v1/"; : {

}
},
"credsStore" : "osxkeychain"
}

Removing
 },
"credsStore" : "osxkeychain"
and ; made it work , JSON was validated:

{
"auths" : {
"https://index.docker.io/v1/": {

}
}
}
